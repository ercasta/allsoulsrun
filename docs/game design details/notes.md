# Notes

- typical run length: 10K encounters? (avg 100 encounters per player level)
- how many areas per world? 10? **Subdivide areas by acts, each act having a final boss before unlocking next area (decided)**
- how to progress within act? Visit different areas?
- how many character levels? **100 (decided)**
- How long should a play last i.e. how long should a player spend on an adventure? A few minutes? hours? Days? weeks? **Hours, maybe over several days, ideally not more than a week or month (depending on the result the player wants to achieve)**. The pattern should be players having their "favourite" parties (player builds and party formations), and configuring runs, running them, looking at results, adjusting either runs or builds / formations. These are not monoliths, they are composable elements. Some of these might be referenced by URIs, so people can publish their builds / formations, and players can just configure runs.
- Unbalance by default: world and rules parameters might vary (e.g. exp required per level; these params are collectively known as "the ruleset" - it will be fun to play with different / "extreme" rulesets)
- Areas have defaults. Of nothing is configured, players are "attracted" to areas according to a criteria (actually, a progression of areas, determined by the adventure, with default rules for retry / advance / fall back)
- Acts can also be played independently. Each act has a starting level, which determines the skill points the players can use.
