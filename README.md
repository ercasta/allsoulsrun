# All Souls Run

A game for RPG stats nerds

The goal of the game is finding a good set of "run strategies" to automatically make our character progress.

Run strategies are which areas to visit, with which skills for each member of the party, and their lineup

Game runs happen without player interaction; just the rules are followed.

Competitions can be established for "best absolute", "best average", etc.

In competitions, not all world information is public. Either a base version is published, but with randomized params (e.g. exp per level), or only general information is known about the areas, and the player has a limited number of runs to try.
