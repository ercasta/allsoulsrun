# All Souls Run

A game for RPG stats nerds

The goal of the game is finding a good set of "rules" to automatically make our character progress.

Rules are about which enemy to chose, wheter to equip a new item, which level to explore, which skill in the skill tree to choose.

Game runs happen without player interaction; just the rules are followed.

Competitions can be established for "best absolute", "best average", etc.
